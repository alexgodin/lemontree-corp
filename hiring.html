    <h1>We're Hiring a Contract Bi-Lingual CS Specialist</h1>
    <p>We're a nimble non-profit tackling some of the biggest problems in NYC's
    food ecosystem. Our core product offerings are a <a
    href="inittogether.nyc">volunteer matching service</a> and an emergency food hotline that connects New Yorkers
    in need with emergency food services.</p>
    <p>We're recruiting a customer service specialist to help us handle more callers on our emergency food hotline.</p>
    <p>You'll be on the front lines, helping people in need get access to food. This is incredibly rewarding work. A typical day will involve fielding inbound calls and following up with callers to learn about their experiences at the sites we refer them to.</p>
    <p>In every interaction we seek to treat clients with the respect and dignity they deserve. That means that we don't rush to finish a call, instead we listen and learn from every single caller. And, it goes without saying that we never talk down to a client.</p>
    <p><strong>To apply, leave a 1-2 minute voicemail in english and spanish at
    <a href="tel:9173367380">
    917-336-7380</a> explaining why you would be a good fit for the
    role.</strong></p>
    <p>This is a four week contract for <strong>40 hours per week of work at
    $640 per week.</strong>You should be able to answer the phones from<strong>
    10am-6pm Monday-Friday.</strong></p>
    <p>Ideally you have <strong>experience in hospitality or customer
    service</strong> (preferably on the phone). You must be <strong>fluent in spanish</strong>.
    This job is 100% remote but you <strong> live in NYC or have lived in NYC long
    enough to have knowledge of the geography of the five boroughs.</strong></p>
